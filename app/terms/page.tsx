        <p>
          Switch Commerce, LLC ("Switch Commerce," "we" or "us") operates the Switch Commerce Services, either alone or in conjunction with its affiliates, agents and partners. The Switch Commerce Online Services Agreement ("SCOSA" or "Agreement") applies to Switch Commerce's Web sites, other electronic channels as described below, and electronic content, services and tools.

In addition, Switch Commerce Services may be available through other computer, telephonic, email or wireless services or systems, including Switch Commerce's proprietary software and services such as VoiceTMSâ„¢, and any other computer, telephonic or wireless service or information system Switch Commerce makes available to you, including successors to the systems described above.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also ask you to follow additional rules, guidelines or other conditions that govern the use of a particular Switch Commerce Service ("Rules and Guidelines") at the time you register for or use that Switch Commerce Service.

        </p>
        <p>
          Switch Commerce may offer you the opportunity to personalize a Switch Commerce Service or your online experience. While certain personalization features can provide a more convenient way to access the data and features most relevant to you, be aware that "cookies" and other similar identification techniques are used to associate you with the computer or electronic device that you are using. If you access Switch Commerce from a public location or if you otherwise share a computer or electronic device, some personalization features could reveal non-public personal information about you to others.

          To protect the privacy and security of your personal information, Third Party Service Providers will only be authorized to use or maintain your personal information only in accordance with Switch Commerce's privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">NOTICES, COMMUNICATIONS, AND ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES</h2>

          You agree to accept all communications from us regarding use of the Switch Commerce Services at the addresses you provide during Registration. Please promptly update any changes to your registration information by using the "My Profile" link associated with each Switch Commerce Service. Switch Commerce is entitled to rely on the email address and U.S. mail address that you last provided to us.

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">SECURITY OF DATA TRANSMISSIONS AND STORAGE</h2>
        <p>
          Electronic (including wired and wireless) communications through the Switch Commerce Services may not be encrypted.

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">MONITORING BY SWITCH COMMERCE</h2>

We and our Third Party Service Providers may monitor your Communications to evaluate the quality of service you receive, your compliance with the SCOSA, the security of the Switch Commerce Services, or for other reasons. You agree that these monitoring activities will not entitle you to any cause of action or other right with respect to the manner in which Switch Commerce or its Third Party Service Providers monitor your Communications and enforce or fail to enforce the Rules and Guidelines of any Switch Commerce Service and the terms of the SCOSA. In no event will Switch Commerce or its Third Party Service Providers be liable for any costs, damages, expenses or any other liabilities incurred by you as a result of any monitoring activities.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">HYPERLINKS</h2>

Switch Commerce does not control these other sites or services, and Switch Commerce makes no representations or endorsements whatsoever concerning those sites or services.

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES</h2>
        <p>
          ALTHOUGH SWITCH COMMERCE TRIES TO PROVIDE ACCURATE AND TIMELY INFORMATION THROUGH ITS SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES, THERE MAY BE INADVERTENT TECHNICAL OR FACTUAL INACCURACIES AND TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. SWITCH COMMERCE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MAKE CHANGES AND CORRECTIONS AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT NOTICE. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." SWITCH COMMERCE DOES NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR TIMELINESS OF THE INFORMATION, TEXT, GRAPHICS, LINKS OR OTHER ITEMS CONTAINED IN THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES. SWITCH COMMERCE PROVIDES NO GUARANTEE AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF DELETION, MIS-DELIVERY OR FAILURE TO STORE COMMUNICATIONS, PERSONALIZED SETTINGS, OR OTHER DATA. SWITCH COMMERCE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN, OR THE MISUSE OR MISINTERPRETATION OF, ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES. SWITCH COMMERCE MAY CHANGE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES AT ANY TIME AND MAKES NO COMMITMENT TO UPDATE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE USE OF THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES.
        </p>
        <p>
          FURTHER, SWITCH COMMERCE MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES. SWITCH COMMERCE AND ITS AFFILIATES AND AGENTS (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, ACCURACY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
        </p>
        <p>
          SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.
        </p>
        <p>
          ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER OR OTHER ELECTRONIC SYSTEM OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM SWITCH COMMERCE OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
        <p>
          YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD SWITCH COMMERCE AND ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AND LICENSORS (INCLUDING THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS) HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, LOSS, COSTS OR EXPENSE, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES, MADE BY ANY PERSON ARISING OUT OF YOUR VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, STATE OR FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR ANY OTHER PERSON'S RIGHTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INFRINGEMENT OF ANY COPYRIGHT OR VIOLATION OF ANY PROPRIETARY OR PRIVACY RIGHT.
        </p>
        <p>
          UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO A NEGLIGENT ACT, WILL SWITCH COMMERCE OR ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, OR LICENSORS (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, ANY SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICE, EVEN IF ANY SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        </p>
        <p>
          IN NO EVENT WILL SWITCH COMMERCE OR ITS THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY TORT, CONTRACT OR ANY OTHER LIABILITY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF A SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICE, OR RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY SWITCH COMMERCE. SWITCH COMMERCE AND ITS THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE TO YOU AND/OR ANY THIRD PARTY, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, OR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, EVEN IF SWITCH COMMERCE OR ITS THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, RESULTING FROM: (i) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES; (ii) THE TIMELINESS, DELETION, MISDELIVERY, OR FAILURE TO STORE ANY USER DATA, COMMUNICATIONS OR PERSONALIZATION SETTINGS; (iii) THE COST OF GETTING SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY PRODUCTS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO, THROUGH OR FROM THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES; (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (v) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANYONE ON THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES; (vi) THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, UNAUTHORIZED USE, PERFORMANCE OR NON-PERFORMANCE OF ANY THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THE THIRD PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED PREVIOUSLY OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; OR (vii) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT IN ANY WAY HOLD SWITCH COMMERCE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SELECTION OR RETENTION OF, OR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF, THIRD PARTIES (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS) IN CONNECTION WITH THE SWITCH COMMERCE SERVICES.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because some states prohibit the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states the limitation of liability only with respect to consequential or incidental damages may not apply to you, and the respective liability of Switch Commerce and its Third Party Service Providers, employees, distributors and agents is limited to the greatest extent allowable under applicable law in those states. In the event that a court or arbitration panel, as the case may be, should hold that the limitations of liabilities or remedies available as set forth in this Agreement, or any portions thereof, are unenforceable for any reason, or that any of your remedies under this Agreement fail then you expressly agree that under no circumstances will the total, aggregate liability of Switch Commerce and its Third Party Service Providers, employees, distributors, agents or affiliates, to you or any party claiming by or through you for any cause whatsoever exceed $100 (U.S.), regardless of the form of action and whether in contract, statute, tort or otherwise.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">RESTRICTIONS ON USE</h2>

        <p>
          Switch Commerce reserves the right to modify or discontinue temporarily or permanently, a Switch Commerce Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that Switch Commerce will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of a Switch Commerce Service. Please keep in mind that extended periods of inactivity may also result in your enrollment in a Switch Commerce Service being canceled. The license granted under the SCOSA will terminate if Switch Commerce believes that any information provided by you, including your email address, is no longer current or accurate, or if you fail to otherwise comply with any term or condition of the SCOSA and all Rules and Guidelines for each Switch Commerce Service. Upon such violation, you agree to terminate access to the Switch Commerce Services.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">GOVERNING LAW</h2>
        <p>
          The SCOSA, and all future agreements you may enter into with Switch Commerce, unless otherwise indicated on such other agreement, will be governed by the law of the state of Texas, without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof. This is the case regardless of whether you reside or transact business with Switch Commerce in Texas or elsewhere. Unless a dispute would be governed by an applicable arbitration clause, you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the City and County of Dallas, Texas. If any part of the SCOSA is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
