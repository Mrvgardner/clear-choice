# How Watchdog Protects Your ATMs from Modern Crime

## From Rising Threats to Smart Protection

In our last article, we explored how ATM crime has shifted in 2024 and 2025—from brute-force attacks and jackpotting to jugging and fraud. For operators, one truth became clear: traditional locks and alarms are no longer enough. Criminals are faster, more resourceful, and more willing to combine physical and digital tactics.

That’s why operators need a security solution that doesn’t just react to crime—but actively works to stop it.
