# ATM Crime Trends to Watch in 2025

## Why ATM Security Still Matters

Cash remains essential to retail, hospitality, and service businesses worldwide. And wherever cash flows, crime follows. Over the past two years, ATM crime has grown in frequency, variety, and sophistication. From brute force thefts to high-tech jackpotting, operators face a broader threat landscape than ever before.

Here’s what you need to know about the crime trends shaping 2025 and what smart operators are doing to protect themselves.

## 1. Physical Attacks Meet Digital Threats

Classic “smash-and-grab” attacks are still common, but they’re now paired with digital methods. Jackpotting, where malware forces the ATM to dispense cash, has resurfaced across the U.S. and Europe. Criminals are also experimenting with glue tampering, overlays, and micro-cameras to steal cardholder data and PINs.

The takeaway? Bolted safes and security glass are no longer enough. Protection has to cover both the machine and the network it’s connected to.

---

## 2. Jugging and Customer Targeting on the Rise

Not all attacks focus on the ATM itself. “Jugging” incidents—where criminals stalk ATM users and rob them after withdrawal—have surged in states like Maryland and Connecticut. These crimes highlight the importance of not only securing the machine, but also ensuring customer safety in and around ATM locations.

## 3. High-Dollar Heists Are Getting Bolder

From ram-raids to vault extractions, criminals are pulling entire machines out of their foundations. In some cases, six-figure amounts are stolen in a single night. These attacks don’t just cause financial loss—they leave behind massive repair costs, downtime, and shaken customer confidence.

---

## 4. Fraud Incidents Outpacing Physical Attacks

Global crime databases show that fraud-related incidents—skimming, card cloning, malware, and network intrusion—now outnumber physical assaults on ATMs. That means a machine doesn’t have to be physically breached to cause devastating financial loss.

## 5. Warning Signs for Operators

Operators should stay alert to red flags, including:

- Unusual transaction errors or spikes in reversal activity
- Misaligned panels, glue residue, or forced fascia components
- Overlay card readers or small cameras near PIN pads
- Customers reporting debits without cash dispensed
- Loitering or suspicious behavior near ATM sites, especially after hours

## 6. The Real Cost of ATM Crime

It’s not just about stolen cash. Downtime, customer trust, insurance claims, and regulatory pressure all add up. A single successful attack can damage more than the bottom line—it can damage your reputation.

## Looking Ahead

ATM crime is not slowing down—it’s evolving. The next step for operators isn’t just reacting faster but anticipating attacks before they happen. That’s why many are looking to layered security and monitoring tools that can detect anomalies in real time.
