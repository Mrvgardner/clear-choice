# The Future of ATMs Is Now: Big Takeaways from NAC 2025

Over the years, I've seen plenty of trends come and go. But this year at NAC 2025, something felt different. The innovations weren't just interesting—they were practical, deployable, and clearly shaping the next chapter of our industry.

Here are the big themes that stood out.

---

## Cash Recycling Goes Mainstream

Cash recycling has been discussed for years, but now we're finally seeing real traction. New machines can accept deposits, validate bills, and reuse that cash for withdrawals. That means fewer armored truck visits, better uptime, and lower costs.

We showcased the **Atec C3L cash recycler** at our Clear Choice Payment Solutions booth, and the excitement was obvious. The ability to offer full deposit capabilities in retail environments is a game‑changer for operators and merchants alike.

Expect recyclers to become a standard offering in more locations over the next few years.

## Ubiquitous Access to Cash (and More)

Despite the rise of digital banking, consumers still want fast access to cash—and they want more services at the ATM.

Companies featured:
- Cardless withdrawals using mobile apps and one‑time passcodes
- Instant balance visibility after cash deposits
- Self‑service bill pay, remittance, and gaming at multi‑function kiosks

Banks are consolidating branches, and ATMs are stepping into the gap. The industry is clearly focused on giving customers more options at the machine.

## Revenue Operations (RevOps) Takes Center Stage

One standout from Clear Choice is our **Watchdog monitoring solution**. It gives real-time alerts on ATM status, suspicious activity, cash levels, and network connectivity. That means issues are addressed faster, uptime stays high, and revenue keeps flowing.

It's not just about transactions—it's about the health of the entire operation.

We saw a surge of tools aimed at:
- Automating merchant commissions
- Delivering real‑time fleet dashboards
- Predicting cash levels with smart forecasting
- Providing transparency to store owners

And with ATM crime rising, 24/7 monitoring platforms like Watchdog are becoming essential. More uptime and better security mean more revenue and happier merchants.

## Clear Choice Powered by Switch Commerce

What encouraged me most was seeing where the industry is headed—and knowing we're already building toward that future.

Between cash recyclers, multi‑service kiosks, and RevOps tools, **Clear Choice Payment Solutions** (powered by Switch Commerce) is positioned to help operators grow with clarity, control, and confidence.

## Final Thoughts

If NAC 2025 proved anything, it's that the ATM isn't going away. It's evolving.

The future belongs to operators who:
- Deploy smarter equipment
- Embrace automation
- Offer more services
- Keep cash accessible

The innovations are here. The demand is here. And for those ready to lean in—the opportunity is bigger than ever.
