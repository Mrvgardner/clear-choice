# Making Convenience Stores Even More Convenient

## How Clear Choice Payment Solutions Helps C-Stores Save Time, Strengthen Security, and Simplify Cash Management

This October, our Clear Choice team had the opportunity to exhibit at the NACS Show—the leading trade event for the convenience and fuel retailing industry. Every year, NACS brings together thousands of store owners, suppliers, and innovators who are shaping the future of convenience retail.

From our booth on the show floor, we spoke with operators from all over the country—each one facing the same challenge: how to manage cash, payments, and security efficiently while keeping their stores running smoothly.

That conversation is at the heart of what we do.

At Clear Choice Payment Solutions, we help convenience store owners take control of every dollar—whether it’s digital or in the till.

## The Cash Management Challenge

C-stores handle hundreds (sometimes thousands) of small transactions a day. Cash comes in, cash goes out, and at the end of every shift someone’s counting, balancing, and bagging deposits for the bank. It’s repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to error.

And with tight staffing and high turnover, operators can’t afford inefficiencies or security risks.

That’s where modern cash recyclers come in.

## Turning Cash Into a Strength

A cash recycler automates counting, sorting, and storage—while making the same cash available for withdrawals and change later in the day. That means fewer bank runs, faster reconciliations, and tighter control over your cash flow.

In short: cash stops being a headache and starts working for you.

Clear Choice helps c-store operators:

- Eliminate nightly bank runs by vaulting deposits directly into the recycler.
- Speed up shift changes with tills that open and close pre-balanced.
- Reduce theft and shrinkage through role-based permissions and audit logs.
- Access real-time data on every dollar entering and leaving the store.

The result? More time serving customers and less time managing cash.

## Beyond the Drawer: Total Payment Confidence

Of course, modern c-stores need more than just a cash solution. They need secure, flexible payment processing that keeps up with customer expectations—whether that’s credit, debit, or digital wallets.

Our systems are designed for reliability and security, built on the same platform that’s operationally hardened and penetration-tested against real-world threats. Combined with our Watchdog monitoring technology, operators can rest easy knowing their transactions—and their terminals—are protected 24/7.

## Built for the Way C-Stores Work

No two locations are exactly alike, so our approach is never one-size-fits-all. We work with independent store owners, multi-site operators, and retail chains to design solutions that fit how they operate.

From cash recyclers and ATM vaulting to merchant services and secure payment processing, Clear Choice helps convenience store operators:

- Cut costs without cutting corners.
- Keep stores running smoothly, even in peak hours.
- Strengthen security and reduce losses.
- Simplify cash flow from register to bank.

## Convenience Should Work Both Ways

At NACS, we saw firsthand how much c-store owners juggle—from inventory to staffing to compliance. Our goal is to make sure payments aren’t another thing on that list.

Whether you’re looking to automate cash handling, upgrade your ATMs, or modernize payment processing, Clear Choice Payment Solutions is here to make your store more secure, more efficient, and—above all—more convenient.
