When it comes to payments, downtime isn't just inconvenient — it's expensive.

Every minute your ATM, kiosk, or POS terminal goes offline, you're losing transactions, customers, and trust. That's why uptime is more than a metric at Clear Choice — it's a mission.

## The Real Cost of Downtime

Whether you operate a busy retail location or manage a fleet of ATMs, reliability is everything. Even short interruptions can:

- **Delay customer checkouts** and create frustration at the point of sale
- **Trigger chargebacks and disputes** when transactions fail mid-process
- **Damage your reputation** as customers lose confidence in your systems
- **Add hours of manual reconciliation** later as you sort through incomplete transactions

Our systems are designed to keep your business moving — and your customers happy — no matter what.
